Data Cleaning & Preprocessing for Machine Learning
This repository demonstrates how to clean and prepare raw data for machine learning tasks using Python. The workflow covers essential preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, standardizing numerical data, and visualizing/removing outliers.
Objective
how to clean and prepare raw data for ML.
Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Workflow
Importing the dataset and explore basic info
Checking for null values and inspect data types.
Handling missing values
Using mean, median, or imputation techniques to fill missing data.
Converting categorical features into numerical
Applying encoding methods to transform categorical columns.
Normalize/standardize numerical features
Scale numerical columns for better model performance.
Visualizing and removing outliers
Using boxplots to detect outliers and remove them using statistical methods.

Dataset
You can use any dataset relevant to the task.
i have downloaded- Titanic Dataset

Getting Started
other following steps with coding and execution are explained in the word file attached.
I am confirming that i have done the task with the help of google and perpelxity ai.
The programme is executed under the platform google colab . 
I have studied and researched about the task and following process and learn the process and steps youtube.
have attached the file with executed code and required output.
thank youðŸ˜Š
